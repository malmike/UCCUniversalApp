You will get a limited number of free databases per account. But you can create other accounts and get as many free databases as you want.

ATTENTION!!!   MySQL databases must be activated @ Account Manager  >> Hit  Create DB   button.

PhpMyAdmin (PMA) is a tool that will help you to administer your database. You don't have privileges to create a database with PMA because, as said before, databases must be created  @ Account Manager using Create DB   button.

Database details (db name, username) will be provided at Account Manager once you create the database.
